All this data can be sent via WeTransfer to SOILTEMP.PROJECT@GMAIL.COM

This is the example file on how to submit your in-situ microclimate data to the SoilTemp database. It consists of multiple tables:

1) Metadata: the core of your dataset, allows us to link your microclimate timeseries to your sites and potential other datasets
2) Raw time series data: the time series of microclimate data
3) People: a list of all the people involved with your dataset and their status (i.e, when to contact them and how to acknowledge their contribution)
4) Vegetation metadata: optional but highly recommended, if you have measured vegetation or soil parameters at the plot level (e.g. LAI), or if you have done vegetation surveys. Can also be provided later
5) Vegetation data: optional extra, details on the plant species composition of your site
6) Species details: optional extra, details on the plant species at your site, e.g., trait data

Please follow the formatting as closely as possible. Instructions for each column are added as comments to the cell
You can submit your data as .csv, .txt or Excel-file, yet in the latter case avoid using cell formatting (e.g. colors or 'time' formatting)

What data can be included?
Time series need to be at least one month long, with a maximum interval of 4 hours between measurements (start and end date, as well as temporal resolution (time interval between two consecutive records) needs to be provided in the metadata file: see next section).  
All microclimate data from any height above or belowground is welcomed (including temperature, soil moisture, relative humidity, wind speed, radiation, ...). Data from experiments is now also included.

Raw time series
- Preferably replace erroneous data by NAs and remove time periods when the sensor was not installed in-situ. Carefully enter the start and end dates of the measurement period in the metadata to avoid usage of ex-situ data. These columns will be used to remove excess data.
- We will run automized data cleaning using the MyClim-package (Man et al. 2023, http://labgis.ibot.cas.cz/myclim/index.html) to flag suspicious data ourselves
- This data can also be submitted in .csv or .txt, as long as the column structure is the same as proposed.
- The data can be submitted in two formats:
o ‘long format’, with all sensors and loggers underneath each other (see example Excel sheet)
o Separate files or sheets for each logger. In that case, the file or sheet name should match EXACTLY with the location or logger code in the metadata file.
- Name matching is HUGELY important for us to link your metadata with your raw data.
